# CODINGDOJO HACK-A-THON EXERCISE: DECK OF CARDS

*Exercise: use pre-built card and deck code files to build a simple card game
*Built the game "Go Fish". 
*The computer will play a fresh game from beginning to end using players specified in the game.py file. Cards are dealt randomly to all players and drawn at random from the remaining deck until either one player has no cards left or there are no cards left in the deck, at which point the game stops. If the game ends because the deck ran out, the computer declares a winner based on which player had the most 4-card-matches during the game.
*Not sure what the point of watching a computer play "Go Fish" with itself is, but it was fun to build!
*Finished the base game on 2/20/23, after just two weeks studying Python in bootcamp.

*I intend to migrate the PlayerList and Scoreboard dictionaries into classes, so I can practice using classes and modules.
