# CODINGDOJO HACK-A-THON EXERCISE: DECK OF CARDS

*Exercise: use pre-built card and deck code files to build a simple card game

*Built a working version of "Go Fish". Finished the base game after just four Python bootcamp classes.

*The computer will play a fresh game from beginning to end using players specified in the game.py file. Cards are dealt randomly to all players and drawn at random from the remaining deck until either one player has no cards left or there are no cards left in the deck, at which point the game stops. If the game ends because the deck ran out, the computer declares a winner based on which player had the most 4-card-matches during the game.

*Pretty boring to watch a computer play a fantasy game of "Go Fish," but it was fun to build!

*I intend to migrate the Playerlist and Scoreboard functionalities into Hand and Player classes in their own separate files, as I get a better handle on OOP.

*Maybe toward the end of bootcamp I can turn this into a working website where a user can interact with the program?
